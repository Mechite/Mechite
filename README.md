If you are contacting me regarding a security issue,<br>
please protect your communications.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Telegram Information</strong></summary>
  
  If you would like an easy method of contacting me with encryption, a Telegram-based secret chat is one of my trusted methods of conviniently communicating safely.
  
  You may contact me with @GameGlitz, documentation on creating a secret chat is available <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#:~:text=Secret%20chats%20are%20meant%20for,(more%20on%20this%20here)">here</a>.

<details>
  <summary><strong>PGP Public Key</strong></summary><br>
  
  Currently, I will not be relying on my PGP key for communications, so Telegram is going to be the only option.
  Therefore, I recommend Telegram is used as it will allow for me to solve the security issue sooner, rather than later.
